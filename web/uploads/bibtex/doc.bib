   note = {This paper presents a model reverse-engineering approach for mobile applications that belong to the GUI application category. This approach covers the interfaces of an application with automatic testing to incrementally infer a formal model expressing the navigational paths and states of the application. We propose the definition of a specialised GUI application model which stores the discovered interfaces and helps limit the application exploration. Then, we present an algorithm based upon the Ant Colony Optimisation technique which offers the possibility to parallelise the exploration and to conceive any application exploration strategy. Finally, our approach is experimented on Android applications and compared to other tools available in the literature.},
